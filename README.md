### Side Note
This is based in large part on the lecture2 notebook, but broken into more modular units. The core "solve_subsistence_problem" routine has been broken out in a Python module, in the src subdirectory.

Other chunks of functionality to read in data and generate plots have been broken out as companion notebooks.

Note that we are using flake8 (https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/2.5.5/) to check for proper formatting of our module code as per PEP8 (https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

### Due Dates

Code Review: March 5
