a team for Project2 in EEP 153

This is based in large part on the lecture2 notebook, but broken into
more modular units. The core "solve_subsistence_problem" routine has
been broken out in a Python module, in the src subdirectory.

Other chunks of functionality to read in data and generate plots
have been broken out as companion notebooks.
